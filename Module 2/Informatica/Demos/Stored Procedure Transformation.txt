Create the following stored procedure in oracle
create or replace procedure calc_bonus(pempno  emp.empno%type, pbonus out number)
as
begin
   select sal*0.20 into pbonus
   from emp where empno=pempno;
end;

In Informatica

A)Connected stored procedure transformation

In the Mapping designer

1) Drag EMP table
Source Qualifier transformation will be created

2) Create a stored procedure transformation(SP_CALC_BONUS)
Use the stored procedure CALC_BONUS. It contains the ports PEMPNO and PBONUS

3)Drag empno from the Source Qualifier transformation into PEMPNO of the Stored procedure transformation
4)Drag EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL,COMM from Source Qualifier transformation to target
5)Drag Bonus field from stored procedure transformation to the target

6) Create a workflow, session and populate the target.

Note : The target table is already created with the appropriate fields

B) Unconnected stored procedure transformation

The same example can be converted to Unconnected stored procedure transformation

1) Remove the  links from empno->PEMPNO i.e from Source Qualifier transformation to the stored procedure transformation 
and from PBONUS to BONUS i.e from stored procedure transformation  to the target

2)Create an Expression Transformation
Drag EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL,COMM from Source Qualifier transformation to Expression transformation

3)Create bonus field in Expression transformation i.e add a port
Make it as an output port and write
:SP.SP_CALC_BONUS(EMPNO,PROC_RESULT) in expression
Hint: Expand the stored procedure folder in the functions tab. You'll see the name of the stored procedure

4) Drag EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL,COMM from Expression transformation to 
the target table
Drag Bonus from Expression transformation to the target table

V. IMP: While creating mapping in designer for stored proc transforamtions,
do 'EDIT',
set Connection Properties to 'SRC' and apply.
