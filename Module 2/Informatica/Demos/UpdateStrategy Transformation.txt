
1)Source Employee->SQEmployee

2) Create a lookup transformation with Lookup Table TGT_employees.
(It has the same structure as employees).
In the lookup transformation, remove all fields except employee id make 
it as Output Lookup Return.

Add a field in the lookup transformation and name it as Employee_ID_IN 
Make it as Input port.
The above transformation is unconnected lookup transformation

3)Create a update strategy transformation and drag relevant  fields 
from SQ->Employees to it
Update strategy  -- Expression
iif(isnull(:LKP.LKP_TGT_EMPLOYEES(EMPLOYEE_ID)),DD_INSERT,DD_UPDATE)

Note:LKP_TGT_EMPLOYEES is the name of unconnected lookup transformation. 
We pass the EMPLOYEE_ID from the SQ(i.e emplyees table) and 
check for its existence in target table
If empid is not found in target we insert else we update.
To Check: update employees set city='seattle' where 
employee id =(Put appropriate employee ID)
See whether the change is reflected in the target.
