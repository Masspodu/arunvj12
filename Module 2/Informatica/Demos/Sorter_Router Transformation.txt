
Mapping Designer
1) Create source based on Employees table
2)Drag all fields from SQ transformation to an Expression Transformation
In the Expression Transformation concatenate Empfirstname and Emplastname
3) Create a sorter transformation
Drag fields(except EMPFIRSTNAME AND EMPLASTNAME BUT INCLUDING EMPNAME)
from Expression transformation to sorter transformation.
Sort on Empname(Can choose Ascending descending)
4) Create a Router Transformation. Drag all fields 
from Srt_Empname to the Router Transformation

Create two groups 
CntryUSA   Grp Filter condition  country='USA'
CntryUK  Grp Filter condition  country='UK'
A default group will automatically exist


The Input group will receive input from Srt_Emp.

The  CntryUSA will redirect the output to the target table TGT_EMPLOYEES_US

The  CntryUK will redirect the output to the target table TGT_EMPLOYEES_UK

Fields of  TGT_EMPLOYEES_UK and TGT_EMPLOYEES_USA are the 
same as that of sorter transformation
